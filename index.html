            "My first ever Isla memory is a core one. On my interview day I saw you doing standards at the front of the shop beside Demi (mongo), you had your og Isla haircut with the fringe, you made eye contact with me for the first time that day. I was too nervous around the really pretty girls so I spoke to the till staff instead."

        <p class="pretty-text">
            "When I got My crush into my bed for the first time I wasn't nervous at all because I wanted her so badly it didn't feel real, you don't get nervous in your dreams. I can perhaps remember every intimate moment with my crush, I was so happy."

    <div class="memory-card">
        <p class="pretty-text">
            "There was a few times my nonchalance may have slipped as when my crush got sick I carried her onto the sofa and made her food while she slept. This is one of my core memories as I was perhaps showing I was in love with this girl. Thankfully she hasn't noticed."

            "I took my crush to Stramash as a treat but all she wanted to do was get me drunk and venerable? In the 10 minute period she wasn't stropping, I carved our names into the table with my key. I walk past that table 5 times a week and every time I think of her looking really pretty at the stramash table."

    <div class="memory-card">
        <p class="pretty-text">
            "I spent 20 minutes at work writing a book for Isla (she's been my favourite for a long time), the book contained one or two nonchalant things I can recall about her. I drove to her house before work and told her sister to make her look out her window. I carried her to my car on my shoulder, she had messy blonde hair that looked so pretty and the cutest smile on her face. Libby took a video of me lifting her from the window, I've watched that video 1000 times. In my boot lay flowers and the book, the last page asked her to be my girlfriend. She whispered in my ear and said yes. Perhaps I'll remember that for the rest of my life, low-key."
